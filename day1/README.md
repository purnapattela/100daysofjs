# Day 1

## JS basics
I am in day1 present focusing on JS basics 

### Things to know before
- Disadvantages of interpreted languages is it can bring run-time errors
- JS supports multi-paradigm like Imperitive, Procedural, OOP, Functional, Prototypal Inheritance
- babel a pre-processor helps old browsers to understandable latest JS code
- v8 uses JIT(just in time compiler) -> code is compiler by the browser but compiled like a interpreter to improve performance optimizations

### What was in the modern js projects
- Package management - npm
- Local http/ws servers - nodejs
- Transform ES2015[ES6] code to ES5 - babel
- Bundle our js dependencies - webpack
- Linting our code - eslint
